## Project Overview

This project fine-tunes and evaluates the **Meta Llama 3 8B-Instruct** model for policy and procedure verification tasks.

The repository contains scripts for model fine-tuning, model testing, and a CSV file with comparison results between the base and fine-tuned models.

Results were saved as csv as that allowed for easier viewing than .txt

Note: Will have to download the model and dataset locally before running on odo.
