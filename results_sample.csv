She followed the instructions provided in the texts to transfer money between her accounts.","Sarah Lee sent a text message with the word â€œHELPâ€ to 77542 to contact the bank's customer service. 

Explanation:
The question is asking about the actions taken by Sarah Lee after registering for the SMS banking service. The correct answer is that she sent a text message with the word â€œHELPâ€ to 77542 to contact the bank's customer service. This is based on the information provided in Policy 1, which states that customers can contact the bank's customer service by sending a text message with the word â€œHELPâ€ to 77542. 

The other options are incorrect because they are not supported by the information provided in the policies. Option A is incorrect because it mentions sending a text message with the word â€œSTOPâ€ to 77542, which is actually the action to opt out of the SMS banking service, not to contact customer service. Option B is incorrect because it mentions sending a text message with the word â€œHELPâ€ to 767666, which is actually the action to cancel text messaging from the bank, not to contact customer service. Option C is incorrect because it mentions contacting the bank's customer service at 1-888-797-7711, which is actually an alternative method of contacting customer service, but not the action taken by Sarah Lee. 

Therefore, the correct answer is Option D, which is the action taken by Sarah Lee to contact the bank's customer service.

He assumed the bank would automatically waive all fees due to the delay, without submitting a written request.","The bank may not waive all fees without a formal request. According to Policy 2, the bank will not charge for documentation obtained in connection with a good faith assertion of error in connection with a transaction, but it does not explicitly state that all fees will be waived without a formal request. Therefore, the customer should submit a formal request to the bank to request a waiver of fees. 

Additionally, the customer should be aware that the bank may delay or block a payment to prevent fraud or to meet regulatory obligations, as stated in Policy 3. This could potentially affect the customer's account and transactions. 

It is essential for the customer to review the bank's policies and terms to understand their rights and responsibilities regarding reporting fraudulent transactions and requesting fee waivers. 

In this case, the customer should contact the bank's customer service at 1-888-797-7711 or write to them at Cadence Bank Customer Service, 2910 W Jackson St., Tupelo, MS 38801, and provide their account number to request a fee waiver and to report the fraudulent transaction. 

The customer should also be aware that the bank may require additional documentation or information to process the request, and the customer may be required to take additional steps to facilitate the deposit of the payment funds into their account. 

Therefore, the customer should act promptly and formally request a fee waiver and report the fraudulent transaction to the bank to minimize any potential consequences. 

The final answer is: The customer should submit","The bank may not waive fees without a formal request, even if the customer delays reporting the fraudulent transaction. The customer is responsible for all fees incurred in connection with the services, and the bank will not charge for documentation obtained in connection with a good faith assertion of error in connection with a transaction. However, the customer must still submit a formal request to the bank to request fee waivers. 

Explanation:
The bank's policy states that the customer is responsible for all fees incurred in connection with the services, and the bank will not charge for documentation obtained in connection with a good faith assertion of error in connection with a transaction. This implies that the customer must submit a formal request to the bank to request fee waivers, even if they delay reporting the fraudulent transaction. The customer cannot assume that the bank will waive fees without a formal request. 

Note: The customer should still report the fraudulent transaction as soon as possible to minimize potential losses. However, they should also submit a formal request to the bank to request fee waivers. 

Also, the bank's policy states that the customer will remain responsible for all payment transactions which they have initiated through the services prior to such cancellation and for all other fees incurred in connection with the services. This means that even if the customer cancels their services, they will still be responsible for any outstanding fees. 

Therefore, the customer should be cautious and submit a formal request to the bank to request fee waivers, even if they delay reporting the fraudulent transaction.
